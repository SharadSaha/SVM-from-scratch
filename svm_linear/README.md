## Linear SVM 
Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data, which means if a dataset can be classified into two classes by using a single straight line, then such data is termed as linearly separable data, and classifier is used called as Linear SVM classifier.

Linear SVM from scratch has been implemented from scratch without the use of scikit-learn functions.
