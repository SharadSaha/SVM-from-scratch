## Radial Basis Kernel Function
In machine learning, the radial basis function kernel, or RBF kernel, is a popular kernel function used in various kernelized learning algorithms. In particular, it is commonly used in support vector machine classification.
When the data set is linearly inseparable or in other words, the data set is non-linear, it is recommended to use kernel functions such as RBF.
